This is a repository for personal website.

This is the personal website for the mid term project. It include the basic component of html, and css style, besides I use the javascript to achieve some interaction function.
Something noticed:
I use the header component in the html to contain the name and belongs, in the top of the personal website.The header is consist of an h1 and p. Besides, in the bottom of the webpage, I define a footer as the end of the webpage, enrich the content of the whole pages.

For the 'body' of the html, except for the porperties like font, padding, I import a background image to make the personal website seems more colorful.
For the main body of the webpage, I define a class selector "container" to contain the various component in the body, the container decide the form of many components. To avoid the conflict between the main body and background image, I set opacity as 80%.

In the container, it contains the following components: Name, Skills, Introduction, Interest, Playlist, Outerlink, Contact Box, Skillbar.

In the section Name, Skills and Introduction, I use the basic structure of html section:Section-h2-p, to finish the basic parts of the personal website. 

In the interest component, I use a ul-li list structure to classify three types of skills. List is useful for making items be more clearly exhibited.

In the playlist, I set an onclick h2 subtitle and banding a javascript to it. The audio playlist is hidden at first, after clicking the subtitle it will be opened. And I set two audio controls in this section, the audio will search and read the mp3 file, everyone can play the audio in the page.

In the outerlink, I try to change the color style of font. And attach 3 outter website link to test the link function. You can click the 'Go Now!' and jump to other pages I recommended.

In the contactbox, to creat a basic model of 'connect me', I use a submission form with 3 blank submit zone. And the submit content need to be correct to click the 'Send Message' button. 'Send Message' button aligned with a js script, after sucessfully clicking, a floating tips window appear.

In the skill bar, I define 3 skill bar with a script. The script will randomly initialize the border of the bar. And, the bar's border will be randomly reset per 1 seconds. You can see in the webpage, the bar is continuely rolling infinitely.

Besides, I add a button component 'return to top'. The button is hidden at first, after the page scrolling over 100px, the button will appear, if less than 100px, the button will disappear again. Click the button, the page scroll will return to the top.

You can check the files of the html and css. The url address of the deployed website is: https://liangchen611.github.io/LiangChen.github.io/.
